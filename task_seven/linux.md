I downloaded ubuntu on virtual machine and it worked

## most of commands that i used:

- ls -a -l (to get a list of files and folders in the directory)
- mkdir (to make new directory)
- cd (to change the current directory)
- nano [file name] (to edit the file)

i created a test.sh file make it print "hello linux" and create new file, after adding the excute 
permition using (chmod) command
